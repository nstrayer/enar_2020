Building an R package alongside a research project serves to strengthen both the package and the research.

No tool existed that:

- Was for R

- Focused on uncertainty

- Allowed us to develop custom methods for bipartite networks etc.

## Too much time is spent fiddling

![:spacePx 60]

- `usethis` and strong defaults help a lot

![:spacePx 60]

## My project isn't strictly methods development

![:spacePx 100]
- The package infrastructure works well for general data-science projects

![:spacePx 60]
- See [Karthik Ram's work on compendiums](http://inundata.org/talks/rstd19/#/).

## I've never made a package before!

![:spacePx 80]

- It's easier than you may think:

- If you want people to use your method, an R package is the most effective way to do so
