# But first... Jargon Break!

# Bi or Poly-partite networks

> Networks that have nodes of multiple distinct types where connections can't form between nodes of the same type.

# The __S__tochastic __B__lock __M__odel?

A network model to cluster nodes into "blocks".

# Why write a package?

.pull-left[

No tool existed that:

- An R package

- Focused on uncertainty

- Allowed us to develop custom methods for bipartite networks etc.
